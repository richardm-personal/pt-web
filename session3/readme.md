# CSS Stylings

Try each of the the following styles in your blog css file

## 1. Text styles

**color**

keywords (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value#Color_keywords)

`p { color: red }`

hexadecimal values

`p { color: #ff0000 }`

rgb

`p { color: rgb(255,0,0) }`

**font-family**

`p {
  font-family: arial;
}`

The browser will only apply a font if it is available on the machine the website is being accessed on. 
There are only a certain number of fonts that are generally available across all systems and can therefore be used without much worry. 
These are the so-called web safe fonts. Check here for a list: https://www.cssfontstack.com/

You can use font stacks to specify fallbacks if your font is not available:

`p {
  font-family: "Trebuchet MS", Verdana, sans-serif;
}`

**font-size**

* In px (pixels)
* In ems (1em is equal to the font size set on the parent element)
* In rems (same as ems but using the root element)
* In % (relative to the parent element)

**font-style** (normal, italic)

**font-weight** (normal, bold)

**text-transform** (none, uppercase, lowercase, capitalize)

**text-decoration** (none, underline, overline, line-through)

**text-shadow** (horizontal offset, vertical offset, blur radius, base colour)

`h1 { text-shadow: 4px 4px 5px red; }`

**text-align** (left, right, center, justify)

**line-height**

## 2. List styles

**list-style-type**: Sets the type of bullets to use for the list, for example, square or circle bullets for an unordered list, or numbers, letters or roman numerals for an ordered list.

**list-style-position**: Sets whether the bullets appear inside the list items, or outside them before the start of each item.

**list-style-image**: Allows you to use a custom image for the bullet, rather than a simple square or circle.

See here for a list of different list styles to try: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/list-style-type


## 3. Link styles

`<p><a href="#">A simple link</a></p>`

You'll notice a few things as you explore the default styles.

* Links are underlined.
* Unvisited links are blue.
* Visited links are purple.
* Hovering a link makes the mouse pointer change to a little hand icon.
* Focused links have an outline around them â€” you should be able to focus on the links on this page with the keyboard by pressing the tab key
* Active links are red (Try holding down the mouse button on the link as you click it.)

Try setting the following selectors to change the default styles

``` 
a {

}


a:link {

}

a:visited {

}

a:focus {

}

a:hover {

}

a:active {

}
```

## 4. Selectors

In the these examples you wil notice that we used some different selectors. Here are the main types of selector you will use. Try them out in your project:

**Type selectors** 

We have already used these quite a lot e.g.

`p { color: red }`

This selects all p tags.

**Class selectors** 

Uses the class attribute. You can also use multiple classes to combine styles.

```
<ul>
  <li class="first done">Create an HTML document</li>
  <li class="second done">Create a CSS style sheet</li>
  <li class="third">Link them all together</li>
</ul>
```

```
/* The element with the class "first" is bolded */
.first {
  font-weight: bold;
}

/* All the elements with the class "done" are strikethrough */
.done {
  text-decoration: line-through;
}
```
**Attribute selectors** 

Matches elements using their attributes. For example a list like this:

```
Ingredients for my recipe: <i lang="fr-FR">Poulet basquaise</i>
<ul>
  <li data-quantity="1kg" data-vegetable>Tomatoes</li>
  <li data-quantity="3" data-vegetable>Onions</li>
  <li data-quantity="3" data-vegetable>Garlic</li>
  <li data-quantity="700g" data-vegetable="not spicy like chili">Red pepper</li>
  <li data-quantity="2kg" data-meat>Chicken</li>
  <li data-quantity="optional 150g" data-meat>Bacon bits</li>
  <li data-quantity="optional 10ml" data-vegetable="liquid">Olive oil</li>
  <li data-quantity="25cl" data-vegetable="liquid">White wine</li>
</ul>
```

Can be styled with CSS:
```
/* All elements with the attribute "data-vegetable"
   are given green text */
[data-vegetable] {
  color: green;
}

/* All elements with the attribute "data-vegetable"
   with the exact value "liquid" are given a golden
   background color */
[data-vegetable="liquid"] {
  background-color: goldenrod;
}
```

**Pseduo-classes**

A CSS pseudo-class is a keyword added to the end of a selector, preceded by a colon (:). We used these when styling the links above.

**Combinators and multiple selectors**

You can combine selectors to make your style target a very specific element. It can also be useful to apply styles accross lots of different elements in one place to save repeating yourself.

So all headers could have the same font for example:

```
h1, h2, h3 {
  font-family: "Trebuchet MS", Verdana, sans-serif;
}
```

There are also different ways of specifying combinations such as matching elements that are descendants of specific elements. For more examples see here:
